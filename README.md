xkcd News Enhancer
=============

This plugin is designed to implement xkcd 1288 to enhance news articles. Installation should be done through the Google Chrome store. Please feel free to fork this project and submit pull requests. I am a Ruby developer, not a Javascript developer, so these are all wonderfully hacked together snippets from Google Extensions examples and Stack Overflow. So please fork and improve.
